# Machine-Learning-Projects-Personal

This repository contains Machine Learning projects I am working on personally as I continue to learn more about Machine Learning. Currently this repository houses: 
1. Predicting Car Prices - which is project that tries to predict car prices utilizing K-Means Clustering 
2. Predicting Stock Prices - The point of this project is really to get some experience with Time Series analysis and the nuances associated with it. The prediction itself is using a simple linear regression.
